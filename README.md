# Street Runner

The aim of this project was to practice using the google API in conjunction with another API. The police API was chosen for use in this project as it contains a lot of information and access which is great for practice.

The project uses the police API information in order to retrive crime information within an area radius of south london. Then with this randomly takes the use to a crime location within the radius on the map at a click of the button. 

The project is not completed, and is under further work to make it even better!
